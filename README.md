# Multinomial Logistic Regression to Predict NCAA Tournament Finishes

A small project in R using multinomial logistic regression to predict the postseason finish for NCAA Tournament teams in NCAA Division I Men's Basketball. My work from a larger group school project working with college basketball data.

Trained on a random sample of all NCAA Tournament teams from the dataset and tested on both the remaining NCAA Tournament teams not used for training, as well as all NCAA Tournament teams from the 2019 NCAA Tournament. Pretty accurate -- usually around 65-73% accurate for each simulation. However, it does struggle with some overpredicting specific rounds, since the program does not know how the tournament works.
